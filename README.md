This project focuses on building a personalized news recommendation system to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Key steps include data preprocessing to clean and prepare data, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns. Feature engineering extracts relevant characteristics to improve recommendation accuracy, while model development creates algorithms to make predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, with further optimization through hyperparameter tuning and new feature incorporation. Finally, the model is deployed in a production environment and monitored over time, often using A/B testing to ensure continuous improvement.
